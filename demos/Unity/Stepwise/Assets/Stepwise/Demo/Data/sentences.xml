		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — A jury resumed deliberating the guilt or innocence of four policemen in the beating of Rodney King on Sunday after five jurors spent the morning attending Easter services.</narrate>
		<narrate>The jurors got under way about noon in their unusual holiday session and planned to continue until 5 p.m.</narrate>
		<narrate>The jury received the federal civil rights case Saturday after a last round of final arguments and spent 2 1/2 hours getting started on their task.</narrate>
		<narrate>All that was known about their initial deliberations was that they chose a foreman, identity unknown, and they set up a schedule.</narrate>
		<narrate>U.S. District Judge John G. Davies was told they planned to meet 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. during the week.</narrate>
		<narrate>Some defense lawyers were at the courthouse and others waited nearby.</narrate>
		<narrate>They were ordered to be available within 15 minutes if jurors need a question answered or announce that they have a verdict.</narrate>
		<narrate>Sgt. Stacey Koon, Officers Laurence Powell, Theodore Briseno and former Officer Timothy Wind are charged with violating King’s civil rights in a beating which the government says was excessive. </narrate>
		<narrate>Although the jurors have been sequestered at a hotel since Feb. 25, they knew when they were chosen that world opinion was focused on the case.</narrate>
		<narrate>All of them said they could put aside concerns about public reaction to their verdicts and decide the case purely on the evidence.</narrate>
		<narrate>Acquittals on most charges in a state trial last year touched off three days of rioting in Los Angeles that left 54 people dead and $1 billion in property damage.</narrate>
		<narrate>“I don’t think anyone should be condemned because of the threat of a riot,” attorney Harland Braun told the jurors in a final argument laced with religious references and comparisons of the defendants to Christ being judged by Pontius Pilate. </narrate>
		<narrate>“If you have the courage to vote not guilty on all these defendants, the public will understand,” Braun assured them.</narrate>
		<narrate>But a prosecutor called the defendants “bullies with badges” and urged jurors to convict them.</narrate>
		<narrate>To convict on civil rights violations, jurors must find that the four men intended to inflict unreasonable force on King.</narrate>
		<narrate>In the state trial last year in suburban Simi Valley, specific intent was not a requirement to convict them of assault. </narrate>
		<narrate>In a poll published Sunday by the Los Angeles Times, 33 percent said a repeat of last spring’s deadly riots was inevitable if jurors acquit the four men. </narrate>
		<narrate>And, although 75 percent of those surveyed voiced concern that another round of unrest could engulf their neighborhoods, 59 percent said they were very or somewhat confident that police would quickly quell it. </narrate>
		<narrate>About 60 percent said they had done nothing to protect themselves in case rioting occurs.</narrate>
		<narrate>Only 4 percent said they had bought guns.</narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — A jury resumed deliberating the guilt or innocence of four policemen in the beating of Rodney King on Sunday after five jurors spent the morning attending Easter services.</narrate>
		<narrate>The jurors got under way about noon in their unusual holiday session and planned to continue until 5 p.m.</narrate>
		<narrate>At one point, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies refused a request by jurors to give them the transcript of testimony by a key witness — California Highway Patrolwoman Melanie Singer. </narrate>
		<narrate>Though she had been called to testify as a defense witness, Singer ended up weeping on the stand, saying she saw one of the officers strike King in the face with a baton.</narrate>
		<narrate>Baton blows to the head are banned by police rules.</narrate>
		<narrate>“Even if I had it, I would not have sent it in because that tends to emphasize testimony,” the judge told lawyers during a brief hearing. </narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jurors reached no verdict Sunday on the officers accused of violating Rodney King’s civil rights, but requested a transcript of testimony from one of the trial’s most dramatic witnesses.</narrate>
		<narrate>Soon after they convened on Easter, the jurors asked for the testimony of California Highway Patrolwoman Melanie Singer, who wept on the stand when she recalled baton blows to King’s head. </narrate>
		<narrate>The request came in a note from the jury’s foreman, identified only as a real estate salesman in his late 30s who said during jury selection that an earlier jury’s acquittal of the defendants on most charges was “no surprise” to him. </narrate>
		<narrate>By the end of Sunday’s session, jurors had deliberated some 7 1/2 hours since receiving the case late Saturday afternoon. </narrate>
		<narrate>Sgt. Stacey Koon, Officers Laurence Powell, Theodore Briseno and former Officer Timothy Wind are charged with violating King’s civil rights in a beating which the government says was excessive. </narrate>
		<narrate>U.S. District Judge John G. Davies said he didn’t have the transcript jurors wanted, adding, “Even if I had it, I would not have sent it in because that tends to emphasize testimony.” </narrate>
		<narrate>Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Clymer then suggested that the jurors be asked if they were concerned about a particular part of the testimony.</narrate>
		<narrate>But Davies said he was reluctant to ask the jurors anything more.</narrate>
		<narrate>Davies told jurors at the outset of testimony to rely on their own memories and notes and said he would not provide them with transcripts.</narrate>
		<narrate>Mrs. Singer’s testimony rocked the trial near the end of the defense case.</narrate>
		<narrate>She was called as a defense witness but gave perhaps the most powerful testimony for the prosecution.</narrate>
		<narrate>Mrs. Singer, the first person to approach King after chasing him for speeding, testified that King was not threatening, that he acted like a “wiseacre drunk” and that police had no justification for beating him. </narrate>
		<narrate>At one point, she burst into tears as she described Powell smashing King in the head with a baton.</narrate>
		<narrate>A key defense contention is that King was never hit in the head but instead fractured his face in a fall.</narrate>
		<narrate>The jury’s note, the first since deliberations began, came just after 2 p.m., about two hours after Sunday’s session began. </narrate>
		<narrate>All lawyers and defendants were in the courtroom except for Briseno who was ill, according to his lawyer. </narrate>
		<narrate>The jury received the federal civil rights case Saturday after a last round of final arguments and spent 2 1/2 hours getting started on their task.</narrate>
		<narrate>Acquittals on most charges in a state trial last year touched off three days of rioting in Los Angeles that left 54 people dead and $1 billion in property damage.</narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — The judge in the Rodney King beating trial refused to give jurors a transcript they requested of testimony by a key witness, a state trooper who wept as she recounted King’s beating. </narrate>
		<narrate>The foreman sent a note Sunday afternoon to U.S. District Judge John G. Davies, saying jurors wanted the transcript of California Highway Patrolwoman Melanie Singer’s testimony.</narrate>
		<narrate>Davies rejected the request immediately.</narrate>
		<narrate>The eight men and four women recessed their deliberations Sunday evening and were to return to their task this morning.</narrate>
		<narrate>At a brief hearing to inform both sides about the note, Davies said he remembered telling jurors at the trial’s start to depend upon their memories and their own notes because he did not plan to provide them with transcripts or read back the testimony. </narrate>
		<narrate>The judge told lawyers he didn’t have a transcript, and a prosecutor offered to provide one but he declined. </narrate>
		<narrate>“Even if I had it, I would not have sent it in because that tends to emphasize testimony,” the judge said. </narrate>
		<narrate>The jury is deliberating civil rights charges against four policemen, Sgt. Stacey Koon, Officers Laurence Powell and Theodore Briseno and former Officer Timothy Wind.</narrate>
		<narrate>They are charged in the March 3, 1991, beating of King, captured on videotape by an amateur photographer and broadcast worldwide. </narrate>
		<narrate>Last year, the same officers were acquitted of most charges in a state trial in suburban Simi Valley, touching off three days of rioting in Los Angeles that left 54 people dead and almost $1 billion in property damage. </narrate>
		<narrate>The jury note disclosed that jurors have selected as their foreman a real estate salesman in his late 30s who said during jury selection that the state jury’s acquittals were “no surprise” to him.</narrate>
		<narrate>He also said he had seen the defendants on TV and “they looked scared.”</narrate>
		<narrate>Defense attorney Harland Braun, who represents Briseno, said after Sunday’s hearing that the jury’s request for Mrs. Singer’s testimony boded well for the defense. </narrate>
		<narrate>“The emotional impact they remember, but the specifics of her testimony need to be read,” he said. </narrate>
		<narrate>Mrs. Singer’s testimony rocked the trial.</narrate>
		<narrate>She was called as a defense witness but gave testimony strongly favorable to the prosecution.</narrate>
		<narrate>Mrs. Singer, the first officer to chase King for speeding, testified that King was not threatening, that he acted like a “wiseacre drunk” and that police had no justification for beating him. </narrate>
		<narrate>She burst into tears as she described Powell smashing King in the head with a baton.</narrate>
		<narrate>A key defense contention is that King was never hit in the head but instead suffered facial fractures in a fall.</narrate>
		<narrate>Defene attorney Michael Stone, who called her as a witness, spent hours seeking to discredit her testimony about his client, Powell.</narrate>
		<narrate>He suggested she doesn’t remember clearly and doesn’t know if Powell hit King in the head.</narrate>

		<narrate>WASHINGTON (AP) — The newly-elected leader of the NAACP said Monday he was concerned about the buildup of a “military apparatus” as authorities in Los Angeles prepare for a verdict in the Rodney King beating trial.</narrate>
		<narrate>The Rev. Benjamin Chavis compared the heightened alert of police and National Guard units to Operation Desert Storm as the United States geared up for war with Iraq.</narrate>
		<narrate>Chavis, appealing for calm, said he was flying to Los Angeles Monday and planned to spend the night in a housing project in South Central Los Angeles. </narrate>
		<narrate>“I want them to know our nation’s oldest and largest civil rights organization is with them,” Chavis said here in an interview on NBC.</narrate>
		<narrate>“We plan to stand in solidarity with them, and we plan to continue to demand that justice be done.” </narrate>
		<narrate>As jury deliberations continued in Los Angeles, police began canceling days off and redeploying staff to put as many as 600 additional officers on duty.</narrate>
		<narrate>Police planned to issue a tactical alert, during which all officers can be called to work, once the jury is ready to announce its decision. </narrate>
		<narrate>The California National Guard also is sending in troops and Gov. Pete Wilson said last week more than 5,000 would be available to help if needed. </narrate>
		<narrate>“I’m very concerned,” Chavis said Monday after watching television news coverage of the preparations.</narrate>
		<narrate>He said the activity “reminds me of the preliminary activities of Desert Storm.”</narrate>
		<narrate>“South Central Los Angeles is a part of the United States, it’s not part of the Saudi Arabian desert or the desert in Kuwait,” he said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“I’m very concerned, with all the military apparatus that is surrounding Los Angeles right now, that the people who live in South Central Los Angeles may in fact become isolated from the rest of the United States. </narrate>
		<narrate>“Law enforcement officials have the responsibility to keep order,” he said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“But what I’m saying is, I want to make sure we don’t go too far and wind up doing something that is provocative.</narrate>
		<narrate>If you do too much, that can provoke unrest and outbreak.” </narrate>
		<narrate>Chavis, 45, was chosen Friday to succeed Benjamin Hooks as executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the nation’s oldest civil rights group. </narrate>

		<narrate>She declared, “I’ll never forget it to the day I die.” </narrate>
		<narrate>The videotape of the beating is not clear enough to distinguish whether King was hit in the head.</narrate>
		<narrate>Medical evidence showed major fractures of his face.</narrate>
		<narrate>Head blows violate Los Angeles Police Department policies because they can be fatal.</narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Hundreds of National Guard troops reported to staging areas Monday and civil rights leaders pleaded for restraint as a federal jury deliberated the case of four policemen accused of beating Rodney King.</narrate>
		<narrate>Shielded from the public’s jitters and the police buildup, the 12 jurors resumed their talks after meeting Easter Sunday afternoon. </narrate>
		<narrate>Scores of TV trucks, satellite dishes at the ready, surrounded the downtown courthouse. </narrate>
		<narrate>Across town, guardsmen banged their rifle butts on the bed of a troop truck in a display of spirit at California National Guard headquarters in Inglewood.</narrate>
		<narrate>About 600 guardsmen reported to area armories by Monday morning and the Police Department put 200 extra officers on the streets at all times in case a verdict in the case triggered violence.</narrate>
		<narrate>However, operations will be routine until the jury reaches a verdict, both agencies said. </narrate>
		<narrate>“Unless there is a call for more, they are going to be here going through some drills, training, probably double-checking their equipment,” said guard Capt. Lisa Corrivaia. </narrate>
		<narrate>Deadly rioting broke out last spring after Sgt. Stacey Koon, Officers Laurence Powell and Theodore Briseno and former Officer Timothy Wind were acquitted of most charges in a state trial. </narrate>
		<narrate>In this federal trial, the four white officers were charged with violating the black motorist’s civil rights during a beating after a highway chase on March 3, 1991. </narrate>
		<narrate>The Rev. Benjamin Chavis, newly elected leader of the NAACP, said Monday he was concerned about the buildup of “military apparatus” in Los Angeles. </narrate>
		<narrate>Chavis compared the heightened alert to Operation Desert Storm as the United States geared up for war with Iraq.</narrate>
		<narrate>“Law enforcement officials have the responsibility to keep order,” he said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“But what I’m saying is, I want to make sure we don’t go too far and wind up doing something that is provocative.” </narrate>
		<narrate>Police Lt. John Dunkin said part of officers’ extensive training since last spring involved “making sure our response is controlled for any type of incident so we don’t overreact.”</narrate>
		<narrate>Police were heavily criticized last spring for their chaotic response to the riots that killed 54 people and caused more than $1 billion in damage.</narrate>
		<narrate>In addition to the 600 guardsmen at armories, at least 5,000 are available in Southern California-based units, Gov. Pete Wilson said last week. </narrate>
		<narrate>The 600 have left work for a week and will train mostly in the armories’ yards, said Sgt. Phil Jordan. </narrate>
		<narrate>Police began canceling days off and redeploying staff to put about one-third more officers, or 200, on the streets during each of the department’s three eight-hour shifts. </narrate>
		<narrate>The action stops short of a tactical alert, in which all officers can be called to work and police put less emphasis on non-essential calls.</narrate>
		<narrate>That alert will be called once the jury is ready to announce its decision, Dunkin said. </narrate>

		<setdate>Mon, 12 Apr 1993 23:09:00 GMT</setdate>
		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Poker-faced and silent, jurors in the Rodney King beating trial have been a tough group to read, revealing little about their lives under virtual house arrest and nothing about their leanings. </narrate>
		<narrate>And with plans for their immediate evacuation after their verdict to avoid any possible violence, even explanations of their decisions in the closely watched cases may remain a mystery, until or if they come forward on their own. </narrate>
		<narrate>“Our guys want to get the jury out of there,” said Bill Licatovich, spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service, which is guarding the jurors.</narrate>
		<narrate>“They don’t even want to wait 15 minutes.</narrate>
		<narrate>They won’t take any chances.”</narrate>
		<narrate>But while the public only has scraps of information about them, the jurors deliberating the fate of four policemen since Saturday have had even less information about what’s going on outside. </narrate>
		<narrate>Confined to a secret hotel since Feb. 25, the jurors have been shut off from news of the city’s bracing for the possibility of more riots. </narrate>
		<narrate>Marshals have censored their newspapers, monitored their television viewing, eavesdropped on their phone conversations with friends and relatives and escorted them wherever they go. </narrate>
		<narrate>And when five jurors went to Easter services, their ministers were asked to avoid mentioning the case. </narrate>
		<narrate>“I am informed that the ministers have obliged,” said U.S. District Judge John G. Davies. </narrate>
		<narrate>What little is known about the panel has emerged from jury selection, their demeanor in the courtroom, and their occasional notes and comments to the judge.</narrate>
		<narrate>The panel is made up of nine whites, two blacks and one Hispanic.</narrate>
		<narrate>The inclusion of the blacks, one over defense objections, is notable because the state trial jury that acquitted the white officers of most charges had no blacks. </narrate>
		<narrate>As foreman, the panel selected a white real estate salesman in his late 30s who said during jury selection the state court acquittal did not surprise him. </narrate>
		<narrate>The jurors have revealed nothing in their body language — although every yawn, nod and gesture generated speculation about their thinking. </narrate>
		<narrate>The jurors appeared to listen intently to testimony from both sides.</narrate>
		<narrate>About half took notes, and often they leaned forward to get a better look at the witnesses, who sat to their left. </narrate>
		<narrate>Early in the trial, there was an indication of minor dissension. </narrate>
		<narrate>A note to Davies asked why the lunch break had to take 1 1/2 hours.</narrate>
		<narrate>It said some jurors were falling asleep in the jury room during the long lunch.</narrate>
		<narrate>When the note was revealed in open court, one juror said the note didn’t come from the entire jury and she didn’t know it had been sent. </narrate>
		<narrate>Davies explained that the long lunch break was necessary for himself and the lawyers to get some work done, and the 90-minute lunches continued. </narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — A Bakersfield radio station, citing unconfirmed reports, went on the air Monday afternoon and said jurors had reached a verdict in the Rodney King beating trial. </narrate>
		<narrate>The jury was still out.</narrate>
		<narrate>With greater frequency than Elvis sightings — and with about as much credibility — verdict rumors cropped up all over uneasy Southern California on Monday.</narrate>
		<narrate>“Every division in this city is getting calls,” said Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Steve Wesselink.</narrate>
		<narrate>“We got one call all the way from London.</narrate>
		<narrate>Even the New York Police Department called.”</narrate>
		<narrate>At about 4 p.m., KKXX-FM in Bakersfield broadcast an unconfirmed report that jurors had delivered not guilty verdicts after three days of deliberations.</narrate>
		<narrate>Then the station issued a disclaimer, said manager Allan Hammerel. </narrate>
		<narrate>“I’m looking into this now,” Hammerel said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“My program director told me that the verdicts were in.”</narrate>
		<narrate>From the Westside to South Central, verdict reports came full circle and then started again.</narrate>
		<narrate>One Venice advertising firm sent its employees home early.</narrate>
		<narrate>A black woman ran breathless into a West Hollywood restaurant screaming “They’re not guilty.”</narrate>
		<narrate>The rumor that would not die speaks volumes about the edginess of Los Angeles as it waits for word from the courtroom of U.S. District Judge John G. Davies.</narrate>
		<narrate>Twelve federal jurors are deciding the case of four white officers accused of violating the civil rights of black beating victim Rodney King.</narrate>
		<narrate>“Everyone’s so tense,” said Andrew Posey, spokesman for the United Way of Greater Los Angeles, where several employees had heard rumors that a verdict had been reached. </narrate>
		<narrate>Freelance writer Michael Szymanski was having lunch in a West Hollywood restaurant when a woman burst through the door announcing that the verdicts had been returned.</narrate>
		<narrate>“There’s a lot of really weird stuff going on today,” Szymanski said. </narrate>
		<narrate>News agencies logged scores of calls from the public and from media colleagues, all reporting they had heard jurors were in, or were coming in, or were perhaps thinking about coming in sometime Monday. </narrate>
		<narrate>The LAPD received about 50 such calls, some saying the verdict would be read at a specific time.</narrate>
		<narrate>The county Sheriff’s Department got the same kind of calls.</narrate>
		<narrate>“First they were saying 3 p.m.; now they’re saying 4 p.m.,” said sheriff’s spokesman Bob Stoneman. </narrate>
		<narrate>Rumors and fears of street violence prompted two youth groups to cancel plans to attend Monday night’s Los Angeles Clippers basketball game, said team spokesman Mike Williams. </narrate>
		<narrate>False verdict stories also swept Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in West Hollywood and UCLA’s campus newspaper, the Daily Bruin. </narrate>
		<narrate>“It’s important that people know that there is no foundation to the rumors,” said Stoneman.</narrate>
		<narrate>“This is the type of rumor that can make a problem for everybody.”</narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Peter Ueberroth, leader of the Rebuild LA agency attracting investment to the inner city, chastised the news media Tuesday for portraying the city as a deepening vortex of poverty and violence. </narrate>
		<narrate>“Los Angeles is simply evolving,” said Ueberroth, the former Olympics czar and baseball commissioner.</narrate>
		<narrate>“The city will again be the kind of city others look to for how to solve their problems.”</narrate>
		<narrate>Time magazine’s cover story this week was titled: “Los Angeles: Is the City of Angels Going to Hell?”</narrate>
		<narrate>Other reports have depicted a city in the suffocating grip of fear on the eve of verdicts in the second Rodney King beating trial.</narrate>
		<narrate>In a recent interview, Ueberroth said most news media coverage of Rebuild LA has been fair.</narrate>
		<narrate>To date, the agency has solicited $450 million in corporate contributions and pledges for job training centers and numerous other projects. </narrate>
		<narrate>But he attacked what he called “a doomsday philosophy that is harmful to the city and frankly destructive.”</narrate>
		<narrate>“There’s some conscientious reporting and there is also a different category of mad dogs racing after a meat truck,” he said. </narrate>
		<narrate>Much of Rebuild LA’s first year was spent organizing an 80-member board of directors and assorted task forces.</narrate>
		<narrate>Ueberroth also repeatedly found he had to explain what Rebuild LA isn’t: a riot reconstruction agency, a disaster aid source, a branch of local government. </narrate>
		<narrate>Ueberroth, who is spending five years as chief of the non-profit group, acknowledged that progress has been frustratingly slow.</narrate>
		<narrate>Much of the blame, he said, belongs to the state and federal governments, which have yet to adopt incentives such as tax breaks and enterprise zones for business to invest in inner city Los Angeles. </narrate>
		<narrate>“These companies are doing it without any incentives.</narrate>
		<narrate>And they just had a riot.</narrate>
		<narrate>When are people going to realize that’s heroic?” he said.</narrate>
		<narrate>Ueberroth admitted that many short-term expectations of inner city residents haven’t been met.</narrate>
		<narrate>“I think the frustration may be more,” he said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“Can we impact everybody?</narrate>
		<narrate>No.</narrate>
		<narrate>... (But) the best place to job hunt is not to be standing by something that was burned out 10 months ago.”</narrate>
		<narrate>Still, Ueberroth predicted Los Angeles won’t see a repeat of 1992’s destructive riots. </narrate>
		<narrate>“I believe that the huge majority of the people living in the inner city have seen that the reaction of April 29 really only hurt themselves and their friends and their family and their associates, hurt or killed them, and that there’s nothing to be gained,” he said. </narrate>
		<narrate>Ueberroth’s task has been complicated by the highly publicized troubles in the California economy, some related to defense cuts, some to the state’s allegedly hostile business environment. </narrate>

		<narrate>By The Associated Press</narrate>
		<narrate>Charges in the federal indictment of four policemen in the Rodney King beating:</narrate>
		<narrate>COUNT ONE — Alleges that Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind and Theodore Briseno “while acting under color of the laws of the state of California, aiding and abetting each other, did willfully strike with batons, kick and stomp Rodney Glen King.”</narrate>
		<narrate>By these actions, the indictment says, they willfully deprived King of the constitutional right “not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law, including the right to be secure in his person and free from the intentional use of unreasonable force by making an arrest under color of law.” </narrate>
		<narrate>COUNT TWO — Alleges that Stacey Koon, a police sergeant, “did willfully permit other Los Angeles police officers in his presence and under his supervision ... (to) unlawfully strike with batons, kick and stomp Rodney Glen King ... and did willfully fail to prevent this unlawful assault; resulting in bodily injury to Rodney Glen King.”</narrate>
		<narrate>The indictment alleges this deprived King of a constitutional right “not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law, including the right to be free from harm while in official custody.” </narrate>
		<narrate>Maximum possible penalties for all defendants are 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.</narrate>
		<narrate>Minimum penalties are subject to complicated federal guidelines, and trial participants said they are not calculated unless there is a conviction. </narrate>

		<narrate>The four white officers were acquitted April 29 on state assault charges in the black motorist’s beating, touching off riots that killed 54 people. </narrate>

		<narrate>Meanwhile, the message from politicans, police and celebrities was to “chill,” or keep calm. </narrate>
		<narrate>“Let’s stop the rumors,” Mayor Tom Bradley told about 100 members of Neighbor to Neighbor, a door-to-door campaign to defuse tensions. </narrate>
		<narrate>“Rumors have been spreading like wildfire,” the mayor said of the stories that had a verdict had been reached and that gang assaults were planned.</narrate>
		<narrate>In South Central Los Angeles, where the trouble started last year, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters handed out letters saying, “It’s time to chill.” </narrate>

		<narrate>He assured them police wouldn’t be pulled from the suburbs if trouble broke out in the inner city, and he urged people to leave their guns at home. </narrate>

		<narrate>U.S. District Judge John G. Davies summoned attorneys into court to make the announcement.</narrate>
		<narrate>The nature of the illness was not disclosed, but the judge said the jury intended to resume deliberations at 8:30 a.m. Thursday with the juror. </narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Four policemen on trial in the Rodney King beating have talked with an agent about selling interviews after a verdict is returned, attorneys said Wednesday. </narrate>
		<narrate>“They have been advised by a consultant and an agent that they should not be giving sound bites because it will decrease the commercial value of their story,” said Michael Stone, Officer Laurence Powell’s attorney.</narrate>
		<narrate>Stone said he wasn’t representing Powell in any entertainment or publishing deals.</narrate>
		<narrate>Powell, Officer Theodore Briseno, ex-officer Timothy Wind and Sgt. Stacey Koon are accused of depriving King of his civil rights in the 1991 beating videotaped by an onlooker. </narrate>
		<narrate>The officers could get 10 years in prison if convicted.</narrate>
		<narrate>A federal jury’s deliberations were scheduled to continue for a sixth day Thursday.</narrate>
		<narrate>The four officers were acquitted on most charges in a state trial a year ago.</narrate>
		<narrate>Rioting followed that killed 54 people and left $1 billion in damage.</narrate>
		<narrate>Powell had been scheduled to appear on PBS’ “MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour” Tuesday night but cancelled because of advice from an agent whom he identified only as “Mr. Beck,” Stone said. </narrate>
		<narrate>Stone said there have been talks involving all four men.</narrate>
		<narrate>“There is substantial commercial interest in all four of them together and I don’t begrudge them that,” Stone said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“They’ve been deprived of substantial income for two years.</narrate>
		<narrate>They’re entitled to that.”</narrate>
		<narrate>Attorney Harland Braun said his client, Briseno, has hired an agent.</narrate>
		<narrate>Braun said he doesn’t represent Briseno in any entertainment deals.</narrate>
		<narrate>Koon’s lawyer, Ira Salzman, said, “My client has an agreement for exclusive interviews with one or more organizations.”</narrate>
		<narrate>He wouldn’t elaborate.</narrate>
		<narrate>Paul DePasquale, Wind’s attorney, wasn’t available for comment. </narrate>
		<narrate>After the officers’ state trial last year, Koon wouldn’t comment, telling reporters: “Read it in the book.”</narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — A police show of force, the mustering of troops and pleas for peace during deliberations in the Rodney King beating case apparently have made the streets safer: Authorities on Wednesday reported a dip in the murder rate. </narrate>
		<narrate>“I don’t know if we can say death took a holiday, but it looks that way,” said Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the county coroner’s office, which handles an average of five murders daily. </narrate>
		<narrate>Stung by criticism it was slow to react to unrest after innocent verdicts in the state trial a year ago, law enforcement officials have put hundreds of additional officers on the street.</narrate>
		<narrate>National Guard troops were training at armories as the jury deliberated charges that four officers violated King’s federal civil rights when they beat him March 3, 1991. </narrate>
		<narrate>Deliberations were interrupted in their fifth day Wednesday when a juror got sick and went to a doctor, but U.S. District Judge John G. Davies said he expected jurors to resume their work Thursday morning. </narrate>
		<narrate>A police presence has been noticeable on the streets since deliberations began Saturday afternoon.</narrate>
		<narrate>There were some murders reported over the weekend, but the Sheriff’s Department, which handles unincorporated parts of Los Angeles county, said no new murders were reported since early Monday. </narrate>
		<narrate>“The high police presence can contribute to this,” Deputy George Ducoulombier said. </narrate>
		<narrate>The Los Angeles police said it didn’t yet have statistics, but the coroner’s office, which handles the entire country, reported no homicides in the 24-hour period ending Wednesday morning. </narrate>
		<narrate>Capt. Patrick Froehle of South Central’s crime-ridden 77th Street Division, just a mile from the flashpoint of last year’s riots at Florence and Normandie avenues, said officers were pleased with the drop in slayings. </narrate>
		<narrate>“It may have something to do with more police on the streets.</narrate>
		<narrate>Then again, it may have to do with other things,” Froehle said. </narrate>
		<narrate>Curtis Owens, executive director of the African American Community Unity Center, said community peace efforts also were helping. </narrate>
		<narrate>“The real credit goes to the people of the community working to develop a presence of peace,” Owens said.</narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Deliberations in the Rodney King beating trial were interrupted in their fifth day Wednesday when a juror got sick and went to a doctor.</narrate>
		<narrate>U.S. District Judge John G. Davies said he expected jurors to resume deliberations Thursday morning on whether four police officers violated King’s federal civil rights in the videotaped beating.</narrate>
		<narrate>The jury has deliberated 25 1/2 hours.</narrate>
		<narrate>In a state trial last year, jurors deliberated 32 hours before acquitting the officers of most charges.</narrate>
		<narrate>The acquittals sparked riots that left 54 people dead and caused $1 billion in damages.</narrate>
		<narrate>Also Wednesday, state prosecutors said they planned to drop the sole remaining charge against Officer Laurence Powell, accused of delivering the most blows to King, regardless of the outcome of the federal trial. </narrate>
		<narrate>Jurors acquitted the three other officers of all charges against them last year but deadlocked on the one charge against Powell.</narrate>
		<narrate>California double jeopardy law prohibits retrial on state charges of a case that has been resolved in federal court, said Mike Botula, spokesman for the district attorney’s office. </narrate>
		<narrate>Botula said the state case won’t be retried even if a mistrial is declared in the federal case because “it’s time to put the matter behind us.”</narrate>
		<narrate>In the federal case, Davies summoned lawyers and the police officers to his courtroom for a “proceeding,” but didn’t elaborate, prompting a flurry of speculation inside and outside the courthouse about whether the jury had reached a verdict. </narrate>
		<narrate>The proceeding was delayed for an hour when one defense lawyer couldn’t be found.</narrate>
		<narrate>When it began, Davies took the bench and told lawyers he hoped they would stay within 10 minutes of the courtroom at all times. </narrate>
		<narrate>Davies said a juror had become ill and requested medical attention.</narrate>
		<narrate>He didn’t disclose the nature of the ailment or indicate which of the jurors, whose identities have been kept secret, was afflicted. </narrate>
		<narrate>Davies said the juror was going to a family doctor, accompanied by a federal marshal.</narrate>
		<narrate>The other 11 jurors returned to the hotel where they are sequestered.</narrate>
		<narrate>Attorneys said that if the juror became too sick to continue, one of three alternate jurors would be chosen by lot to enter the deliberations. </narrate>
		<narrate>“The real problem is if the new juror gets in there, they have to start all over again,” said defense attorney Harland Braun.</narrate>
		<narrate>Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Clymer said he too hoped Davies wouldn’t dismiss the ill juror.</narrate>
		<narrate>Jurors had been deliberating whether Sgt. Stacey Koon, Officers Powell and Theodore Briseno and ex-Officer Timothy Wind, all white, deprived black motorist King of his civil rights.</narrate>
		<narrate>An onlooker videotaped police beating King after a traffic stop March 3, 1991. </narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Day 5 of deliberations in the Rodney King case was cut short when a juror fell ill, raising fears the jury might have to start over. </narrate>
		<narrate>The unidentified juror was taken to a doctor by a federal marshal as the rest of the anonymous panel returned to its hotel Wednesday afternoon.</narrate>
		<narrate>U.S. District Judge John G. Davies did not disclose the nature of the illness.</narrate>
		<narrate>Davies said he wanted the panel to reconvene this morning with the juror back in place.</narrate>
		<narrate>Lawyers indicated that complex legal maneuvering would result if the juror were unable to continue deliberating.</narrate>
		<narrate>Three alternate jurors remained sequestered at the hotel with the others, but they have not been deliberating. </narrate>
		<narrate>Loyola University Law School Professor Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor, said the judge could go forward with an 11-member jury unless attorneys wanted to replace the juror with an alternate chosen by lot. </narrate>
		<narrate>“The real problem is if the new juror gets in there, they have to start all over again,” said Harland Braun, the lawyer for Officer Theodore Briseno. </narrate>
		<narrate>The jury is weighing charges that Briseno, Sgt. Stacey Koon, Officer Laurence Powell and former Officer Timothy Wind violated King’s civil rights when he was clubbed, kicked and shocked with a stun gun in a 1991 beating that was videotaped by an onlooker.</narrate>
		<narrate>The officers could get 10 years in prison.</narrate>
		<narrate>As of Wednesday, the jury had deliberated 25 1/2 hours. </narrate>
		<narrate>In the officers’ state trial last year, the jury deliberated 32 hours over seven days before acquitting the defendants on all but one charge.</narrate>
		<narrate>The acquittals touched off riots that left 54 people dead and caused $1 billion in damage.</narrate>
		<narrate>State prosecutors said Wednesday that the remaining charge, against Powell, will be dropped because California double-jeopardy law prohibits retrial on state charges of a case that has been resolved in federal court. </narrate>
		<narrate>Police have put extra officers on the street to ward off a repeat of the violence, and National Guardsmen have been mobilized.</narrate>
		<narrate>The law enforcement presence may already have had an effect: The murder rate took a dip this week.</narrate>
		<narrate>“I don’t know if we can say death took a holiday, but it looks that way,” said Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the county coroner’s office, which handles an average of five murders a day.</narrate>
		<narrate>None were reported in the 24 hours ending Wednesday morning.</narrate>
		<narrate>Meanwhile, defense attorneys said all four officers have talked to agents about selling interviews after the verdict. </narrate>
		<narrate>“They have been advised by a consultant and an agent that they should not be giving sound bites because it will decrease the commercial value of their story,” said Powell’s lawyer, Michael Stone. </narrate>
		<narrate>“The publicity has destroyed these defendants’ lives.</narrate>

		<narrate>The 12 jurors sent no immediate word of their progress.</narrate>
		<narrate>They took lunch at their usual time.</narrate>
		<narrate>The panel, sequestered since Feb. 25, had deliberated a total of 25 1/2 hours since Saturday when the juror’s illness cut Wednesday’s session short.</narrate>
		<narrate>No information about the illness was disclosed, and the jurors haven’t been identified. </narrate>
		<narrate>Sgt. Stacey Koon, Officers Laurence Powell and Theodore Briseno and ex-Officer Timothy Wind, all white, were charged with depriving black motorist King of his civil rights during the March 3, 1991, beating after a traffic stop. </narrate>
		<narrate>They were acquitted on most charges during last year’s state assault trial.</narrate>
		<narrate>After that verdict was announced April 29, three days of rioting left 54 people dead and caused $1 billion in damages. </narrate>
		<narrate>To prevent another riot, community leaders have taken to the streets urging peace when the verdicts are read.</narrate>
		<narrate>Hundreds of additional police officers patrol the city and the National Guard is standing by.</narrate>
		<narrate>Meanwhile, for the third time in two weeks, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies criticized reporters covering the trial and threatened for the first time to shut down the trial press room. </narrate>
		<narrate>He contended a TV reporter violated a court order by broadcasting a closed-circuit press-room speaker feed of proceedings in the courtroom Wednesday.</narrate>
		<narrate>Unlike many state courts, federal courts don’t allow cameras or recording equipment in trials. </narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — A juror whose illness had halted deliberations in the federal Rodney King beating trial rejoined the panel Thursday for a sixth day of talks.</narrate>
		<narrate>The jury reached no verdict by day’s end.</narrate>
		<narrate>The federal jury now has deliberated longer than a state jury did last year before acquitting four police officers of most assault charges in King’s beating.</narrate>
		<narrate>Since Saturday, the federal panel has deliberated for 33 hours, an hour more than the state jury spent. </narrate>
		<narrate>Wednesday’s deliberations were cut short when a juror fell ill and went to a doctor.</narrate>
		<narrate>No information about the illness was disclosed, and the jurors haven’t been identified. </narrate>
		<narrate>Sgt. Stacey Koon, Officers Laurence Powell and Theodore Briseno and ex-Officer Timothy Wind, all white, are charged in the federal trial with depriving black motorist King of his civil rights during the March 3, 1991, beating after a traffic stop. </narrate>
		<narrate>After the state verdict was announced April 29, three days of rioting left 54 people dead and caused $1 billion in damages. </narrate>
		<narrate>To prevent another riot, community leaders have taken to the streets urging peace when the verdicts are read.</narrate>
		<narrate>Hundreds of additional police officers patrol the city and the National Guard is standing by.</narrate>
		<narrate>Meanwhile, for the third time in two weeks, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies criticized reporters covering the trial and threatened for the first time to shut down the trial press room. </narrate>
		<narrate>He contended a TV reporter violated a court order by broadcasting a closed-circuit press-room speaker feed of proceedings in the courtroom Wednesday.</narrate>
		<narrate>Unlike many state courts, federal courts don’t allow cameras or recording equipment in trials. </narrate>
		<narrate>Davies initially ordered media lawyers to show why the press room shouldn’t be closed.</narrate>
		<narrate>But after KCBS-TV reporter Bob Jimenez and a lawyer met with the judge, Davies sent word that he had rescinded that order and would reinstate Jimenez’ trial credentials, which he had lifted briefly. </narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Rumors about what gangs are planning over the Rodney King beating verdicts abound in this jittery city.</narrate>
		<narrate>Truth is, some gang members say they’ve got nothing planned except keeping cool and staying home. </narrate>
		<narrate>“In my neighborhood, everybody’s talking about keeping the peace,” said Mike Baker, a member of the Five Duces, one of several gangs that signed a truce a year ago in the South Central community. </narrate>
		<narrate>“We’re not going to come out here and act ignorant.”</narrate>
		<narrate>Baker and about 25 fellow gang members, all retired — at least for the time being — showed up at the African American Community Unity Center on Wednesday to support neighborhood activists Danny Bakewell and former football player Jim Brown in advocating nonviolence. </narrate>
		<narrate>“We want to make it clear that the African-American community is not crazy,” Bakewell said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“There won’t be any violence coming from this community.”</narrate>
		<narrate>A federal jury deliberated Friday for the seventh day in the trial of four police officers accused of violating King’s civil rights with a beating that was captured on videotape.</narrate>
		<narrate>They were acquitted of most charges during a trial on state charges and the verdicts set off deadly riots in South Central and elsewhere.</narrate>
		<narrate>Paul Jones, interim project manager of the county’s Community Youth Gang Services, said peace is on the minds of the gang members he knows. </narrate>
		<narrate>“They’re not planning to do anything except stay at home and kick it — you know, chill,” Jones said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“The whole attitude on the part of the gang members is it’s all about peace.”</narrate>
		<narrate>Jones said the Watts truce, a cease-fire signed by several area gangs, including factions of the notorious Crips and Bloods, still holds and there has not been a single gang-war killing since it was signed in March 1992. </narrate>
		<narrate>Some gang members have joined the county gang program and other community groups in appeals for peace.</narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Deployment of additional police officers and National Guard troops since the start of deliberations in the Rodney King beating case has already cost taxpayers more than $2 million, authorities said Friday. </narrate>
		<narrate>For each day the jury is out, the bill goes up another $370,000 for officer overtime and troops on standby, measures taken to prevent civil unrest following verdicts. </narrate>
		<narrate>There were 54 deaths and $1 billion in damages when rioting followed the April 29, 1992, acquittal of the officers on most charges in the state case. </narrate>
		<narrate>An additional 600 officers are on the street daily and more than 600 National Guard troops are bivouacked in area armories.</narrate>
		<narrate>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has yet to step up patrols and begin 12-hour shifts.</narrate>
		<narrate>The guard’s deployment began Monday and, at $200,000 a day, the cost reached $1 million by Friday, according to Maj. Gen. Tandy Bozeman’s office. </narrate>
		<narrate>“It comes from the taxpayers and it’s expensive,” Gov. Pete Wilson said last week. </narrate>
		<narrate>It costs the city $170,000 in overtime every 24 hours for more officers during jury deliberations.</narrate>
		<narrate>That deployment began last Saturday night, said Lt. John Dunkin, pushing the taxpayer pricetag past $1 million by Friday. </narrate>
		<narrate>The heightened state of readiness was defended as necessary to assure residents they will be safe when the verdicts are rendered.</narrate>
		<narrate>Police Chief Willie Williams maintained law enforcement was poised to help, not oppress. </narrate>
		<narrate>“If we see criminal behavior, the order is arrest and hold their ground,” Williams said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“But at the same time, we’re not going to assume that everyone in that area is a criminal. </narrate>
		<narrate>“That’s a very, very important message because we have to live with the men and women in those communities beyond any events that may occur over the next few months.” </narrate>
		<narrate>Meantime, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said during a Friday appearance in South Central Los Angeles that police may have a plan to deal with anything bad in the inner city, but lawmakers still don’t have a plan to bring in any good. </narrate>
		<narrate>Jackson urged young South Central residents to channel their anger in peaceful ways.</narrate>
		<narrate>“That becomes the challenge for young L.A.</narrate>
		<narrate>You must turn pain to power — not pain to more pain.</narrate>
		<narrate>Pain to power!”</narrate>
		<narrate>Mayor Tom Bradley said he doesn’t expect any violence when the verdicts come in this time.</narrate>
		<narrate>“It got out of hand (a year ago) because the police simply did not respond fast enough and effectively enough,” Bradley said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“That has changed.</narrate>
		<narrate>We’ve got a new chief of police and we’ve got a new plan and I’m confident that they are going to be equal to anything that might occur.</narrate>
		<narrate>“We do not expect any problems.</narrate>
		<narrate>We certainly don’t expect a repetition of the riots of 1992.”</narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — If the verdicts in the second Rodney King beating trial are broadcast live, it will be an extraordinary and perhaps precedent-setting event in a federal criminal case. </narrate>
		<narrate>U.S. District Judge John G. Davies, presiding at the trial of four police officers accused of violating King’s civil rights, decided Friday to allow the electronic media to broadcast a live audio feed when the verdicts are read. </narrate>
		<narrate>The audio would come from closed-circuit speakers in a media room two floors away from the courtroom.</narrate>
		<narrate>On Thursday, Davies had threatened to close the room after some of the proceedings were broadcast inadvertently. </narrate>
		<narrate>Media cameras and microphones have been outlawed in federal courts for nearly 50 years as a general rule, said Timothy Dyk, a Washington lawyer who has represented news organizations fighting the ban. </narrate>
		<narrate>Dyk was part of the legal efforts that led to recent exceptions: a three-year experiment ending in 1994 that allows TV coverage in six federal district courthouses and two circuit courts of appeal.</narrate>
		<narrate>However, those experiments have involved civil cases — lawsuits — not criminal prosecutions. </narrate>
		<narrate>Dyk said the broadcast of even a small portion of a federal criminal trial would be “highly unusual.”</narrate>
		<narrate>“I think it is fair to say it has rarely if ever happened before,” he said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“There was one instance some years ago where a judge may have allowed it.”</narrate>
		<narrate>He could not recall the details of that case.</narrate>
		<narrate>David Sellers, chief spokesman in Washington for the federal judiciary, said recently that many federal judges still strongly oppose broadcasts. </narrate>
		<narrate>However, Dyk said he believes the opposition is far less strong than a decade ago.</narrate>
		<narrate>Widespread broadcasts of state court trials and the success of the federal court experiment in districts like Philadelphia have proved that cameras and microphones do not necessarily disrupt proceedings, he said. </narrate>
		<narrate>If Davies allows the broadcast, it would be in apparent defiance of Rule 53 of federal court regulations adopted in 1946, Dyk said.</narrate>
		<narrate>He said it’s unclear to him how much discretion federal judges have in breaking such a procedural rule.</narrate>
		<narrate>Mark Mendenhall, assistant circuit executive of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees federal courts in California and eight other states, said Davies’ decision appeared to be a violation of Rule 53. </narrate>
		<narrate>That rule prohibits federal judges from allowing broadcasting of judicial proceedings.</narrate>
		<narrate>“There’s always a possibility that someone would object, based on the rule, and then the judge may have to reconsider his decision,” Mendenhall said. </narrate>
		<narrate>Davies didn’t disclose how much notice city officials will receive of a verdict.</narrate>
		<narrate>Broadcast reporters who met with him said the judge will not allow the broadcast of notes from the jury or of a deadlock.</narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Demand for protection by residents nervous about post-Rodney King beating trial violence has overwhelmed private security firms.</narrate>
		<narrate>“We are in a full, flat-out recruiting mode at many of our Southern California offices,” said Peter C. Sawyers, marketing vice president at Pinkerton Security and Investigation Services based in suburban Van Nuys. </narrate>
		<narrate>“We have seen a tremendous upsurge in demand, no question about it,” said Sawyers.</narrate>
		<narrate>“Our phones are ringing off the hook, the incoming calls are unbelievable.</narrate>
		<narrate>We are having to really juggle and marshal our manpower resources very carefully in the current situation.”</narrate>
		<narrate>Other guard companies report similar results.</narrate>
		<narrate>Pinkerton recently hired several hundred guards to augment its 2,500-member county force.</narrate>
		<narrate>The company considered bringing in guards from as far away as Denver and Las Vegas, but those cities also have a demand for security, said Sawyers. </narrate>
		<narrate>“Business is booming all over the country,” said Howard W. Ross, executive director of the Chicago-based trade organization International Association of Security Services. </narrate>
		<narrate>The $17 billion security guard industry has grown about 35 percent since 1990, with much of that business stimulated by last year’s Los Angeles riots, deliberations in the federal trial of officers in the King beating and the Feb. 26 terrorist bombing of New York’s World Trade Center. </narrate>
		<narrate>“We have been almost constantly out of personnel ... basically since deliberations started,” said Kurt Strasser, president of Westridge Security in suburban West Hills. </narrate>

		<narrate>Possible next steps once the jury in the Rodney King federal civil rights case makes an announcement about its deliberations:</narrate>

		<narrate>— If jurors acquit some or all of the four, there could be no further federal criminal prosecutions.</narrate>
		<narrate>Three officers who still are on the Los Angeles police force still face department disciplinary hearings, however; the fourth, who was a rookie on probation, has been fired. </narrate>
		<narrate>— If jurors tell the judge they are deadlocked on charges against some or all defendants, the judge could send them back with instructions to do their best to reach a verdict, or accept the declaration and declare a mistrial. </narrate>
		<narrate>Federal prosecutors then would decide whether to seek a new indictment against the officers or drop the charges.</narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Rumors about what gangs are planning over the Rodney King beating verdicts abound in this jittery city.</narrate>
		<narrate>Truth is, some gang members say they’ve got nothing planned except keeping cool and staying home. </narrate>
		<narrate>“In my neighborhood, everybody’s talking about keeping the peace,” said Mike Baker, a member of the Five Duces, one of several gangs that signed a truce a year ago in the South Central community.</narrate>
		<narrate>“We’re not going to come out here and act ignorant.”</narrate>
		<narrate>Baker and about 25 fellow gang members, all retired — at least for the time being — showed up at the African American Community Unity Center on Wednesday to support neighborhood activists Danny Bakewell and former football player Jim Brown in advocating nonviolence. </narrate>
		<narrate>“We want to make it clear that the African-American community is not crazy,” Bakewell said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“There won’t be any violence coming from this community.”</narrate>
		<narrate>Nevertheless, police citywide were on tactical alert Friday night after receiving word that a federal jury would make an announcement in the case Saturday morning.</narrate>
		<narrate>It wasn’t known whether the jury would announce verdicts or a deadlock.</narrate>
		<narrate>The jury had deliberated for 40 hours over seven days in the trial of four police officers accused of violating King’s civil rights with a beating that was captured on videotape.</narrate>
		<narrate>They were acquitted of most charges during a trial on state charges and those verdicts set off deadly riots in South Central and elsewhere.</narrate>
		<narrate>Paul Jones, interim project manager of the county’s Community Youth Gang Services, said peace is on the minds of the gang members he knows. </narrate>
		<narrate>“They’re not planning to do anything except stay at home and kick it — you know, chill,” Jones said.</narrate>
		<narrate>“The whole attitude on the part of the gang members is it’s all about peace.”</narrate>
		<narrate>Jones said the Watts truce, a cease-fire signed by several area gangs, including factions of the notorious Crips and Bloods, still holds and there has not been a single gang-war killing since it was signed in March 1992. </narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — The jury deciding whether four policemen violated Rodney King’s civil rights in his videotaped beating planned an announcement Saturday.</narrate>
		<narrate>Police went on a citywide tactical alert, and churches held all-night prayer vigils in a neighborhood hit hard by last year’s riots. </narrate>
		<narrate>It wasn’t clear whether the federal jury would report a verdict or a deadlock.</narrate>
		<narrate>Whatever the result, Mayor Tom Bradley said in a televised address to the city Friday night: “Let’s all take a deep breath.</narrate>
		<narrate>Let’s all keep cool.</narrate>
		<narrate>... Keep the peace, because without it there can be no justice.” </narrate>
		<narrate>By day’s end Friday, the jury had deliberated 40 hours over seven days.</narrate>
		<narrate>A state jury a year ago took 32 hours to acquit the same four officers of most assault charges in the King beating, verdicts that led to three days of deadly rioting. </narrate>
		<narrate>Stanley Sheinbaum, a member of the city Police Commission, told The Associated Press he had been informed “there’s going to be an announcement from the jury.” </narrate>
		<narrate>Asked if the jury would be returning a verdict, Sheinbaum said, “Is a hung jury a verdict?”</narrate>
		<narrate>Told that it was not, Sheinbaum would say only: “I assume it’s going to be a result.” </narrate>
		<narrate>The jurors had gone back to the hotel where they are being sequestered at 4 p.m.</narrate>
		<narrate>The police tactical alert was declared at the same time, said Officer Francine Spada, a police spokeswoman.</narrate>
		<narrate>Officers on duty can’t go home until the alert is canceled.</narrate>
		<narrate>Bradley said the jurors asked to return to court Saturday at 7 a.m.</narrate>
		<narrate>That’s 90 minutes earlier than they usually meet.</narrate>
		<narrate>There was no indication why they wanted to come in early.</narrate>
		<narrate>A police department source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said all of the city’s police officers were told to report for duty at 6 a.m. Saturday. </narrate>
		<narrate>On Friday night, the Police Academy alongside Dodger Stadium was transformed into a staging area for officers and scores of squad cars.</narrate>
		<narrate>At station houses, officers carrying bulletproof vests reported to duty, and lookouts were positioned on station roofs. </narrate>
		<narrate>National Guard troops also have been standing by all week at armories.</narrate>
		<narrate>In his brief address, Bradley added a stern message to his plea for peace: “To those who may be itching for an excuse to harm our neighbors, I have this warning: You will not get away with it, so don’t even try.” </narrate>
		<narrate>Other community leaders also urged calm.</narrate>
		<narrate>“Be cool,” said the Rev. Cecil Murray of First AME Church in South Central Los Angeles, scene of some of the worst rioting last year. </narrate>
		<narrate>Murray and others planned an all-night vigil at the church.</narrate>
		<narrate>He said people remained calm and smiling, “but the bottom lips tremble a little bit.” </narrate>

		<narrate>LOS ANGELES (AP) — His name is a household word, his videotaped beating by police a worldwide symbol.</narrate>
		<narrate>But Rodney King largely remains a mystery.</narrate>
		<narrate>The 28-year-old high school dropout, convicted robber, husband, former Dodger Stadium usher and self-described “decent human being” has slowly emerged from seclusion in recent months, however. </narrate>
		<narrate>He sat behind home plate Tuesday during the baseball season opener at Dodger Stadium as guest of Los Angeles outfielders Eric Davis and Darryl Strawberry.</narrate>
		<narrate>That day a federal jury less than a mile away was deliberating the fate of four policemen charged with violating his civil rights.</narrate>
		<narrate>TV cameras were shooed away, and King, hidden in a straw hat and dark sunglasses, left in the eighth inning. </narrate>
		<narrate>“He’ll never have a normal life,” Davis said. </narrate>
		<narrate>“He shouldn’t have to hide,” said Strawberry. </narrate>
		<narrate>The focus on King has been unremitting since he was beaten March 3, 1991. </narrate>
		<narrate>The bystander’s amateur videotape of his bashing that was seen worldwide, over and over, leaving an indelible impression on millions of TV viewers.</narrate>
		<narrate>Then came the fiery and bloody riots of spring 1992 after four policemen were acquitted in state court of most assault charges.</narrate>
		<narrate>The fury and devastation of his city brought King out of a year’s hiding.</narrate>
		<narrate>He went on television the third and last day of the riots and in a shaking voice pleaded: “Can we all get along?”</narrate>
		<narrate>It was at this year’s federal trial of the same officers that King testified publicly for the first time.</narrate>
		<narrate>Seeming more confident than in previous public appearances, King told jurors, “I was trying to stay alive.” </narrate>
		<narrate>King remains shielded by his lawyer.</narrate>
		<narrate>Where he lives or how he supports himself isn’t disclosed.</narrate>
		<narrate>After speaking in court, King was whisked away. </narrate>
		<narrate>In a rare interview, he told a local radio station in December: “I’m tired of people judging me.”</narrate>
		<narrate>He called himself a “decent human being, just like anyone else.” </narrate>
		<narrate>Last November, King accepted the invitation of black students to speak at an Orange County high school.</narrate>
		<narrate>He told them he was shattered when the officers were acquitted of assault and he urged the young people to stay in school.</narrate>
		<narrate>School officials repudiated the visit, calling it unauthorized. </narrate>
		<narrate>King was born in Sacramento and raised in the Los Angeles suburb of Altadena.</narrate>
		<narrate>He was convicted of a 1989 convenience store robbery, served prison and after his release found temporary work at Dodger Stadium.</narrate>
		<narrate>He was on parole at the time of the beating.</narrate>
		<narrate>Since then, King has been arrested for allegedly soliciting a transvestite prostitute, beating his wife and drunken driving.</narrate>
		<narrate>No charges were filed in any of the cases.</narrate>
		<narrate>King, meanwhile, is suing the city of Los Angeles for $50 million. </narrate>

		<narrate>By The Associated Press</narrate>
		<narrate>Comparisons between federal and state Rodney King beating trials:</narrate>
		<narrate>— State charges were assault and assault under color of authority, based on use of excessive force.</narrate>
		<narrate>Federal charges involve deprivation of civil rights, also based on excessive force. </narrate>
		<narrate>— Federal charges require proof of intent to deprive someone of a federally protected right — in this case, the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.</narrate>
		<narrate>Civil rights weren’t an issue in state court.</narrate>
		<narrate>— State jury in suburban Simi Valley had 10 whites, one Asian, one Hispanic; federal jury in Los Angeles had nine whites, two blacks, one Hispanic. </narrate>
		<narrate>— King didn’t testify in state trial, did in federal trial. </narrate>
		<narrate>— Three of the four defendants, Sgt. Stacey Koon and officers Laurence Powell and Theodore Briseno, testified in state court.</narrate>
		<narrate>Only Koon testified in federal trial; lawyers said he spoke for all defendants.</narrate>
		<narrate>Fourth defendant in both trials was former Officer Timothy Wind.</narrate>
		<narrate>— In state court, Briseno testified against his co-defendants.</narrate>
		<narrate>In federal trial, officers’ united defense was undermined when U.S. District Judge John G. Davies let jurors see videotaped excerpts of Briseno’s state testimony. </narrate>
		<narrate>— California Highway Patrol Officer Melanie Singer, star prosecution witness in state court, was called as defense witness in federal trial.</narrate>
		<narrate>But her tearful account of King’s beating and claims that he was struck in the head appeared more helpful to prosecution.</narrate>
		<narrate>— Judge at state trial, Stanley Weisberg, barred some expert witnesses, questioning their expertise and ruling their views were no more than common sense.</narrate>
		<narrate>Davies allowed testimony in federal trial from all experts offered by both sides, making no judgment on expertise.</narrate>
